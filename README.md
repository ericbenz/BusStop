# BusStop
Final project for [COSI 136a Automated Speech Recognition](http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~cs136a/) (Prof. Marie Meteer). Essentially looking to develop an app that will allow us to roughly build on the functionalities already within 'NextBus', but enhance it with an ASR system. All this will be tailored specifically to MBTA bus routes using the [MBTA Developer Portal](http://realtime.mbta.com/portal).
