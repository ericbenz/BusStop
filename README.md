# BusStop
Final project for [COSI 136a Automated Speech Recognition](http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~cs136a/) (Prof. Marie Meteer). Essentially looking to develop an app that will allow us to roughly build on the functionalities already within 'NextBus', but enhance it with an ASR system. All this will be tailored specifically to MBTA bus routes using the [MBTA Developer Portal](http://realtime.mbta.com/portal).

### Group Members
All students below are Brandeis Computational Linguistics MA 2016s

### To Do List
- add destination pin at destination
- figure out how to get bus routing information
- look into geographical coverage for transit routing
