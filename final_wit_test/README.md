# final_wit_test
This is a simple rough implementation of [wit.ai](https://wit.ai) ASR implemented in swift with some of the additional functionality we are looking for. The code is based off aaronabentheuer's wit.ai swift [implementation](https://github.com/aaronabentheuer/wit-ios-helloworld-swift), linked in the main README page.

## Getting started

Replace `xxx` with your access token in `AppDeletage.swift`:
```
Wit.sharedInstance().accessToken = "xxx" // replace xxx by your Wit access token
```
