# final_wit_test
Downloaded and used aaronabentheuer's [wit.ai swift implemtation](https://github.com/aaronabentheuer/wit-ios-helloworld-swift) since all the wit.ai guides are written for Objective-C only. Built up around this.

Will obviously change the name of this source directory at some point to reflect the current app build, but for now, since we're in prelimary phases still it's fine.

## Getting Started

Replace `xxx` with Eric's access token in `AppDeletage.swift`:
```
Wit.sharedInstance().accessToken = "xxx"
```

## Code to checkout
Most of the code we'll need to work on can be found in `ViewController.swift`.
